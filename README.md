This project aims to implement a simple text editor with the following features:
- Font family selector with a list of all Google Fonts.
- Font weight selector showing the appropriate font weights supported for the selected font family.
- Italic toggle that is active only if the selected font family and weight combination supports italic.
- Auto-save functionality that saves the text, font family, and font weight locally in the browser.
- On reloading the page, the existing content should load with the correct font family and variant selected in the dropdown.
